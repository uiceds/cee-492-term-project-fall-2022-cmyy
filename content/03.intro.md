## Proposal:

We plan to develop a model that can predict the extent of children-friendliness of adoptable dogs based on the dog’s origin information, such as the dog’s breed, color, age and so on, so that families with children can take this model for reference when planning to adopt a dog. We will start by finding the correlation between the dog’s features and env_children in the dataset. We will then evaluate the indices to obtain the extent of the children-friendliness of a dog.


## Exploratory Data Analysis

A persuasive prediction model needs to be trained on the data with enough scale. Thus, before we move to the model part, we need to figure out the distribution of data itself.

First, we want to know the amount of data of each breed. Notice that many mixed breed dogs miss their secondary breed, so instead of considering secondary breeds, we only focus on their primary breeds. The sorted amount of each primary breed is shown in Figure 1.

![Figure 1](https://github.com/uiceds/cee-492-term-project-fall-2022-cmyy/blob/main/Figure%201.png)
Figure 1. Amount of each Primary Breed

There are 203 primary breeds, however, most of them do not have enough data to support for a meaningful model. We choose those amount that are larger than 1000, which is shown in Table 1.


|      Primary Breed      |   Amount   |
|-------------------------|------------|
|   Labrador Retriever    |    3625    |
|     Pit Bull Terrier    |    3077    |
|        Chihuahua        |    1740    |
|       Mixed Breed       |    1454    |
|         Terrier         |    1264    |
|          Hound          |    1112    |
|          Boxer          |    1080    |
|     German shepherd     |    1029    |
Table 1. Amount of each Primary Breed (Only shows those amount that are larger than 1000)


After sorting the amount, we want to have a brief knowledge of each breed with their children friendliness tend. Here, we made a group bar plot that shows the fraction of children friendliness with respect to their primary breed.

We also want to know how efficient the actions (fixing or house training) would be to make each breed to be friendly with children. Thus, we collected those dogs with and without fixed or trained to make another grouped bar plot. We only show data without any actions, the actions process would be the same as this.

Figure 3. Children-Friendliness by Breed without actions

Finally, considering some breeds might be larger on size, or the amount of data in particular age, particular sex and particular size might be very small. Thus, we need to know the distribution of our data in each combination. Here we only show the distribution of “Labrador Retriever”, the process is the same in other breeds.

![Figure 4](https://github.com/uiceds/cee-492-term-project-fall-2022-cmyy/blob/main/Figure%204.png)
Figure 4. The distribution of “Labrador Retriever” in each combination

We could know that the size of “Labrador Retriever” usually “Large” or “Extra Large”, so we could only focus on these sizes when establishing the prediction model of this breed. 

We could also realize that the fixed “Labrador Retriever” is much more than unfixed (around 20%). But considering the scale of our dataset (3625), we could still have 725 data. We say that this is enough to establish a persuasive prediction model.


## Predictive Modeling

The idea is to create different layers with different aspect. (The order of layers could be “sex”, “age”, “size”, “fixed”, “house training”), then we feed this structure with the data to train it (“minimize residual”)
