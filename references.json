    "abstract": "This paper proposes a customized convolutional neural network for crack detection in concrete structures. The proposed method is compared to four existing deep learning methods based on training data size, data heterogeneity, network complexity, and the number of epochs. The performance of the proposed convolutional neural network (CNN) model is evaluated and compared to pretrained networks, i.e., the VGG-16, VGG-19, ResNet-50, and Inception V3 models, on eight datasets of different sizes, created from two public datasets. For each model, the evaluation considered computational time, crack localization results, and classification measures, e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Experimental results demonstrated that training data size and heterogeneity among data samples significantly affect model performance. All models demonstrated promising performance on a limited number of diverse training data; however, increasing the training data size and reducing diversity reduced generalization performance, and led to overfitting. The proposed customized CNN and VGG-16 models outperformed the other methods in terms of classification, localization, and computational time on a small amount of data, and the results indicate that these two models demonstrate superior crack detection and localization for concrete structures.",

    "abstract": "<p>This dataset is the conglomeration of the cataloged crack\ndatasets from the literature, making an extremely diverse crack dataset. There\nwere over 10,995 images which have been merged from CFD (Shi, Cui, Qi, Meng,\n& Chen, 2016), Crack500 (Yang et al., 2020), CrackTree200 (Zou, Cao, Li,\nMao, & Wang, 2012), DeepCrack (Y. Liu, Yao, Lu, Xie, & Li, 2019), Eugen\nMiller (Yang et al., 2020), GAPs (Eisenbach et al., 2017), Rissbilder (Yang et\nal., 2020), non-crack (Dorafshan, Thomas, & Maguire, 2018), and Volker\n(Yang et al., 2020). The majority of pixels were in the background class at\n97.2%, and a little over 2.8% were in the crack class. This was expected, since\ncracks take up only thin lines of space on most images. The images were resized\nto 512x512 for training and testing the DeeplabV3+ model. The original and\nresized images are included. The data was split 90% training, and 10% testing\nby randomly sorting the data. After training with the DeeplabV3+ model (DOI: 10.7294/16628596),\nwe were able to receive approximately 70% accuracy for detecting concrete\ncracks in the image. More details of the training, the results, the dataset,\nand the code may be referenced in the journal article. The GitHub repository\ninformation may be found in the journal article.</p><p><br>If you are using the dataset in your work, please include <b>both </b>the journal article and the dataset citation. <br></p>",
